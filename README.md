# Content-Based Recommender

This  project was created in my journey towards being a Data Scientist, in order to practice what I learn.

The objetive of this project is to create a hybrid book recommendation system that combines three types of recommenders:

- Simple recommender (top rated books)
- Collaborative filtering engine (readers like  you also enjoyed these books)
- Content-based recommender (other books like this)
